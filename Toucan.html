            <p>The toucan is a colorful bird with a large, bright beak. It lives in the rainforests of Central and South America. Toucans eat fruits, insects, and small animals, and they use their beaks to reach food on branches. They are social birds, often seen in small groups, and are known for their loud, distinctive calls.</p>
