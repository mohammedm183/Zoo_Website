            <p>The rhino is a large, strong animal with thick gray skin and one or two horns on its nose. It lives in grasslands and forests in Africa and Asia. Rhinos eat plants like grass and leaves, and they need a lot of food every day. Even though they look dangerous, they are usually calm unless they feel threatened.</p>
